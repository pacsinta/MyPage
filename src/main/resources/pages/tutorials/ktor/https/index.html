      When you send data through public network you need care about the security.
      If you do not encrypt your data anyone can read anything you sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Http doesn't encrypt anything. It only sends raw data between the server and the client.
      That's why we nowadays mostly use https instead of just http. But what is the difference between them?

    <p>
      Https is http with ssl encryption. It uses the standard http protocol to create the communication and then it
      encrypts with ssl.

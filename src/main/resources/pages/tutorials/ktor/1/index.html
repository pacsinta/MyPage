        <p>
            Ktor is a framework for building web applications.
            It means that we can build a web application like a web page or a web api with it.
            It is based on kotlin and provides asynchronous programming with coroutines.

        <p>
            To create your first project you need to install Intellij IDEA.
            It is a good (and currently the only usable) IDE for kotlin, but it is power hungry.

            It has a paid version, but for hobby project you can use the free community version with a some limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the community version is totally enough for the projects in this tutorial,
            I should mention that if you are a student you can get a student license for free.
        </p>
        <p>
            To download the IDE I recommend to use the Toolbox app from this link:  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/">JetBrains Toolbox</a>.
            It is a great tool for installing and managing all your IDE from JetBrains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way is just to download the installer from the links below.

        <p>
            Now that we installed Intellij we can start our first ktor project.
            Open intellij and click the new Project button.
            You should see a similar window to this:
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/newproject.png" alt="new project" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            Choose the ktor generator on the left to create the project.
            Now feel free to change the name, the location and the website domain of the project.
            Leave the other fields as they are.
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/nameproject.png" alt="configure project" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            Now we can add some plugins for our project.
            For out first project we only need the Routing plugin. It can be easily added by searching the plugin and clicking the add button.
            After this we can finally create the project by clicking the create button.
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/addplugin.png" alt="add plugin" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            The creating can take a while, but after the project is created you should see a message like this:
            BUILD IS SUCCESSFUL in 1m50s.
            This means that the project was created successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the left side of the IDE you should see the project tree.
            For this project we care only about the first folder.
            You can open it by clicking the arrow icon next to the folder name.
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/tree.png" alt="project tree" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            In this chapter we only need to care about the src folder.
            Open it!
            It contains a main and a test folder.
            The test folder contains the test cases for our project and the main folder contains
            the code for the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the main folder we can see a kotlin and a resources folder.
            Open the kotlin folder.
            Now you should see a file called Application.kt
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/fulltree.png" alt="full project tree" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            After opening the Application.kt file we can see a few lines of code.
            Change the host value from "0.0.0.0" to "127.0.0.1".
            Now you can run the project by clicking the green triangle next to the "fun main()".
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/1/helloworld.png" alt="hello world project" class="w3-image">
        <p>
            If the project building was successful you should see the following message at the bottom of the screen:
            "Responding at http://127.0.0.1:8088"
            By clicking on the blue link you can open your first page in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can see a page with the text "Hello World" in your default browser you are done with this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Congratulations you made your first website with Ktor!

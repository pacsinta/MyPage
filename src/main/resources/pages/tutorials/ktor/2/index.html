            Ktor is a framework for building web applications. But what ia a web application? What is framework?

            A web application means a program in which a client can get data from a server over the network.
            For example when you visited this website you made a request and my server sent you this webpage.

            A framework makes the programming of the server code much easier.
            It has a lot of features that you can use to build your application.
            But first we need to understand the communication mechanism between the client and the server.-

        <p>
            There are multiple protocols that are used to communicate between the client and the server.
            The main ones are HTTP and websockets.
            First we will talk about HTTP.

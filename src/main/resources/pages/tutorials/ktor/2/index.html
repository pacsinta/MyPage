            Ktor is a framework for building web applications. But what ia a web application? What is framework?
        </p>
        <p>
            A web application means a program in which a client can get data from a server over the network.
            For example when you visited this website you made a request and my server sent you this webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            A framework makes the programming of the server code much easier.
            It has a lot of features that you can use to build your application.
            But first we need to understand the communication mechanism between the client and the server.-
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple protocols that are used to communicate between the client and the server.
            The main ones are HTTP and websockets.
        </p>

        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">HTTP COMMUNICATION</span></h5>
        <p>
            The communication has two parts. A request and a response. The request is made by the client to
            the server. And the response is sent by the server to the client.

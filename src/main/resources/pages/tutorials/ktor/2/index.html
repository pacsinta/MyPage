            Ktor is a framework for building web applications. But what iS a web application? What is framework?
        </p>
        <p>
            A web application means a program in which a client can get data from a server over the network.
            For example when you visited this website you made a request and my server sent you this webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            A framework makes the programming of the server code much easier.
            It has a lot of features that you can use to build your application.
            But first we need to understand the communication mechanism between the client and the server.-
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple protocols that are used to communicate between the client and the server.
            The main ones are HTTP and websockets.
        </p>

    <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">HTTP COMMUNICATION</span></h5>
        <p>
            The communication has two parts. A request and a response. The request is made by the client to
            the server. And the response is sent by the server to the client.

            The main HTTP requests methods are:
        </b>
        <div>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; GET - used when you want to fetch data from the server
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; POST - used when you want to add data in the server
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; PUT - used when you want to change the data to the server
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; DELETE - used when you want to delete data from the server
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            You can read more obout HTTP methods at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">MDN</a>

        How can we make a request in ktor?
        <p>
            In the <a href="/tutorials/ktor-1">previous tutorial</a> we created our first server with the following code:
        </p>
        <img src="/tutorial-images/ktor/2/mainFun.png" alt="hello world project" class="w3-image">

        <p>
            Here we can open the  we can move our mouse to the configureRouting() and press ctrl + left click.
            It will open the file .
